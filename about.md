I'm a 42 year old software engineer who studied computer engineering, computer science, and physics.

I'm interested in science, futurology, and collaboration.

Currently, I'm a full stack web developer and have shipped clients for the Web, iOS, and Android. I've worked with Angular, Ionic, MEAN, Typescript, C# and C++. I worked for 15 years at Microsoft as a S/DET in the Internet Explorer, MSN, SQL, and Visual Studio teams.

I strongly believe in testing, clean coding, and lean processes.
